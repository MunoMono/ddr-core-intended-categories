# 🎓 DDR Core Intended Categories

> *“Mapping the institutional DNA of design research.”*

This repository forms the **structural and institutional backbone** of the  
**RCA Department of Design Research (DDR)** project corpus (1962 – 1981).

It defines the *core intended categories* — units, people, funders, periods, and project structures — that underpin the wider **DDR Taxonomic Dataset**.  
Together, these provide the groundwork for comparative analysis of research methods, epistemic stances, and institutional design genealogies.

## 🧠 Intent

This repo represents the **core dataset layer** of the DDR taxonomy:  
- 🏛 *Structural / Institutional* → official project metadata from the V&A DDR archive  
- 🧩 *Taxonomic* → controlled vocabulary for DDR/DEU categorisation  
- 🧭 *Analytical spine* → foundation for residual × reflexive and extended digital enrichment layers  

It is also a **Carbon Design System web interface**, allowing researchers to interactively explore the data in context.
